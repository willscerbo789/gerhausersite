        <h3>Areas of Expertise</h3>
        <p>Modern life has many positive aspects but at the same we are faced with a plethora of new epidemic diseases for which mainstream medicine has few answers. Dr. Richard Gerhauser believes one of the root causes of modern disease is environmental exposures that interfere with recently discovered quantum effects that play key roles in life. This may be where the answer lies to solve current health crises like type 2 diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, mental disorders, arthritis, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease and obesity. You can wait for mainstream medicine to explore this, but don't hold your breath, medicine changes paradigms very slowly. Mainstream medicine is stuck on the reductionist model that has poor results for our degenerative disease explosion. Dr. Richard Gerhauser, a Preventive Medicine Specialist, delivers cutting-edge cures for a wide variety of diseases to his patients at his private practice in Tucson, Arizona. </p>

          <h3>Patient Testimonials</h3>
           <p><em>“There are other ways to treat diseases other than chemo and radiation. I appreciate Dr. Richard Gerhauser's methods and sharing to help others, and yes he is a Christian.”</em></p>

         <p><em>“Dr. Gerhauser is absolutely first-class. He’s the best doctor I’ve ever met. He practices the lifestyle he preaches, and helps get to the bottom of health issues. He doesn't just rush to put you on some prescription drug.”</em></p>

         <p><em>“Though I don't have a diagnosis yet, on my first appointment with him he was very thorough with his questions and all the labs and x-rays that he ordered. He even asked me if there was anything else I wanted to be tested for because he didn't want to take any chances. He made a great first impression on me, I'll definitely keep my follow up appointment.”</em></p>

         <p><em>“He is very knowledgable and willing to go outside of mainstream medicine and take a more functional approach. Tested me for various conditions and diagnosed an autoimmune thyroid disease. Gave me suggestions and options to treat the Underlying problem, not just the symptoms. He practices what he preaches as far as lifestyle and diet changes. Great bedside manner. His medical assistant is great too.”</em></p>

          <p>Degenerative diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, autoimmune diseases, obesity and osteoporosis have become the new plague. Our failed medical system is the leading cause of death in our society closely followed by the degenerative diseases. You, or someone in your immediate family, will needlessly experience untold suffering and early death. New evidence suggests that life expectancy may have peaked and new generations will have a shorter, more disease-filled life. This book reveals how you can change this tragic trend by following the recommendations of Richard Gerhauser, MD, MS, MPH, FACSM, FACPM. </p>
          <p>By following the advice in this book you can avoid the loss of health and sidestep the traps that abound in our path. Dr. Gerhauser will show you how to circumvent our profoundly dangerous healthcare system. Most modern health treatments have been developed in a profit-driven paradigm which completely avoids the most important questions: What is the most effective, safest and cost-effective treatment? He gives examples of common medical conditions that are inappropriately treated with side-effect-laden drugs instead of dealing with the root-cause of the problem. Vested interests now have control of research, legislation, medical training and the policing institutions so that both healthcare providers and patients will never learn the truth.</p>
